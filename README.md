# e-commerce-landing-page

# Overview
My job was to build out this the landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart.

### Built with
- Flexbox
- Mobile first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript (ES6).

### Challenges and what I learned
Most challenges where regarding JavaScript and they included the foloowing;
- Adding items to cart.
- Creating an image slider.
- Switching the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images on the desktop version.

I learn't a lot about creating interactions with JavaScript. I found solutions to the challenges through online resources such as google articles and sites - like   W3Schools.com - and you-tube vidoes.
    
### Continued development
There is always room for improvement so I'm looking forward to working on a couple of more JavaScript projects so that I can improve on my development skills. I'm also going to work on a couple of more challenging projects to get me out of my comfort zone.
